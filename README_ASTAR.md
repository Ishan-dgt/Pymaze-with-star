# pyamaze + A* Maze Solver

This project combines the original **pyamaze** library with an **A* Search demo** similar to the example shown in the YouTube video [A* Search Algorithm in Python - pyamaze](https://youtu.be/W9zSr9jnoqY).

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pyamaze
python maze_astar.py
```
A visualization window will appear showing the maze and the A* pathfinding algorithm in action.
